## My process

Another challenge similar to the previous ones but this time I tried to use new things I'm learning, like improving semantic HTML5 markup, CSS Grid and Mobile-first workflow.

<br>
I'm getting better at using Figma, which is speeding up the first steps of starting to create the page.

<br>
The main difficulty was creating the overlay effect when hovering the cursor over the image. I got a satisfactory result regarding the background color but I didn't get the same with the "view", it should have the solid white color, and not be affected by `opacity: 0.5;`. Any better way to do this?
